## Description

This utility allows one to "convert" JPEG to PDF without recompression. More generally, it combines a sequence of PDF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG images into one PDF.  

The code was originally posted [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46664134/merge-pdf-documents-and-images-into-one-pdf), and later evolved into a more powerful utility. 

The question about JPEG-to-PDF conversion was asked several times (see [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/246647/jpeg-files-to-pdf)), however it is known that [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) uses [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) under the hood, which performs image decompression and then compression (check [this answer comments](https://askubuntu.com/a/473674/164142)) hence `gm convert image.jpg image.pdf` does not fit.

Further, [`pdftk`](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/ ) and [`qpdf`](http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/files/qpdf-manual.html) only take PDF as input, not images. Hence PDF should be created from images upfront and later taken by one of these utilities.

The only utility which does combining of images efficiently is [https://gitlab.mister-muffin.de/josch/img2pdf](img2pdf), written in Python.

I have also done small research and examined PDFs generated by several online services.

These do not perform recompression, but they are online services or commercial products:

*  http://convert-my-image.com/ – based on [iText PDF 5.3.0](https://itextpdf.com/)
*  https://www.pdfpro.co/ – uses [BCL easyPDF](http://www.pdfonline.com/easypdf/)

These services perform recompression:

* https://www.freepdfconvert.com/jpg-pdf
* http://jpg2pdf.com/
* http://www.jpgtopdf.com/

## Usage

`java -jar merge2pdf-1.0.jar [-dpi|-An] one.pdf [two.jpg three.png ...] out.pdf`

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Option</th>
	<th>Comment</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>-dpi</tt></td>
	<td>If image metainformation provides DPI, then scale the image down, namely to <tt>72 / image_DPI × 100%</tt>, where 72 DPI is a standard PDF DPI. This is necessary in case one needs to merge images with different DPI so that they are represented on the same scale in resulting PDF.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><tt>-An</tt>, e.g. <tt>-A3</tt>, <tt>-A4</tt>, <tt>-A5</tt>, ...</td>
	<td>Scale the image down to fit the given page size (A3, A4, ...). If this options is provided, then `-dpi` is implicitly enabled. Also auto-rotation is applied, i.e. if image width is bigger than height and the image does not fit the portrait-oriented page, page orientation is set to landscape and then the image is scaled down (if necessary). Images are anchored to the top-left corner.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that output PDF is overwritten without any warnings.

### Examples

* `java -jar merge2pdf-1.0.jar 1.jpg 2.tiff all.pdf` – merge images `1.jpg` and `2.tiff` into `all.pdf` as is, i.e. each image forms a separate page with the size equal to image

* `java -jar merge2pdf-1.0.jar -A3 1.pdf 2.png 3.png out.pdf` – append images `2.jpg` and `3.png` to `1.pdf` and save the resulting PDF to `out.pdf`; the images are placed to page size A3 and resized (if necessary) to fit the page
